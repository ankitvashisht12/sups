# Vision - SUPS

SUPS is more than a Slack stand-up reminder—it's a **work journal and intelligence platform**.

## The Big Picture

Daily stand-ups capture valuable data: what team members work on, blockers they face, milestones they hit. Most teams let this data disappear into Slack threads. SUPS preserves and transforms it into actionable insights.

```
Daily Stand-ups → Structured Data → AI Analysis → Insights & Growth
```

## Core Value Proposition

| For | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Individuals** | Personal work journal, career narrative, achievement tracking |
| **Managers** | Team visibility without micromanagement, performance context |
| **Teams** | Knowledge sharing, collaboration insights, project history |
| **Organizations** | Workforce intelligence, skill mapping, resource planning |
